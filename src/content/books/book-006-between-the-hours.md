This collection features compressed, emotionally resonant verse that emphasizes what remains unspoken alongside precisely chosen words. The poems inhabit moments suspended in silence and dimness, exploring the spaces that exist after light fades.

"Spare language, compressed emotion...shimmering with multiple meanings...in the stillness between sleeping and the dead...stunningly beautiful book."

–Dzvinia Orlowsky, author of Bad Harvest

"This contemplative work explores temporal interstices and imagines spaces between moments, past, and future. The collection incorporates literary and historical figures including Jack Gilbert, W.S. Merwin, Tu Fu, Heraclitus, Joan of Arc, and Billie Holiday, examining the distances between bodies and surrounding objects."

–Stephan Delbos, Poet Laureate of Plymouth, MA
