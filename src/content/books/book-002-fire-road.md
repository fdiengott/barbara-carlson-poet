A poetry collection that ranges across Hungary, Slovenia, and the United States, exploring themes of love, death, and the unspoken. The work engages with philosophical and literary references including Spinoza, Miro, Chekhov, Orpheus, and Schubert.

"Spinoza is rubbing my glasses again, leaving the middle range blurred for a reason. Any truth is a blur," begins one poem. The collection examines unexpected truths and discovers "haunting music" in the unmusical, creating an essential voice that explores both wondering and mending through the lens of unexpected wonder.

"An amazing first book, a wonder, a book I dearly cherish." Carlson carries readers through philosophical and everyday landscapes, revealing profound insights about light, grace, and the uncanny positions we occupy when contemplating existence.

–Richard Jackson
