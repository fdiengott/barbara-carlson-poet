An anthology of poems and interviews with Slovene poets, A Bridge of Voices: Contemporary Slovene Poets and Poetry (co-edited with Richard Jackson and Cody Taylor), was published by Bridges Press in 2017.

A Bridge of Voices Contemporary Slovene Poetry and Perspectives is a unique anthology of Slovene poets including interviews with the poets as well as essays by and about them.

The discussions include perspectives on their influences, inspirations and poetics, as well as historic, ethical and philosophical concerns from points of view not readily available to English-speaking audiences. Selected poems accompany responses to questions regarding their poetry and its sources posed by the editors. Slovenia is a country small in area but large in scope in its regard toward literature as both treasure and weapon; it lies at the crossroads of eastern and western poetry and poetics.

The poets included are Tomaž Šalamun, Josip Osti, Meta Kušar, Boris Novak, Miriam Drev, Aleš Debeljak, Maja Vidmar, Barbara Korun, Barbara Simoniti, Uoš Zupan, Novica Novakovic, Peter Semolič, Aleš Mustar, Primož Čučnik, Veronica Dintinjana, Aleš Šteger, Alenka Novanovski, and a section on translation by Ana Jelnikar.
