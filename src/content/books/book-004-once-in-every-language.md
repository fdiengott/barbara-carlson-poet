A collection of poetry exploring themes of longing, humanity, and the search for home. The work emphasizes emotional depth and philosophical reflection on what makes us human.

"There is a beneficient knowingness in Barbara Carlson's new book, and by 'knowingness' I mean an absolute, absolving take on what most makes us human–our hunger for a home that doesn't exist but that we can still hear calling to us, more real than any mere reality. These aching, beautiful, elegiac poems move me over and over with their wonder at all this. They do not wish to be free of any of it. They wish to be full. And are."

–David Rivard
